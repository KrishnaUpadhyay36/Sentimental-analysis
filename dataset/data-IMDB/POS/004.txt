Infinity War is truly a masterpiece

10 years of Marvel cinematic universe coming together for an ambitious and exhilarating biopic - welcome to Avengers: Infinity War. In similarity with the brilliant storyline execution present in Game of Thrones, Avengers: Infinity War effortlessly ties in multiple character storylines to show the rush to save the universe from Thanos and his quest for 'balance'. A whole lot of laughter and tears later, I found myself on the edge of my seat, counting down the days until we see what happens next! 

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War lived up to my high expectations on all accounts - all except one! In such a blockbuster masterpiece that has A-lister and A-lister and spared no expense in doing so, it seemed a little bittersweet to not have Hugo Weaving return as the voice of Red Skull. Just a minor detail in what is easily now my favourite Marvel film.
