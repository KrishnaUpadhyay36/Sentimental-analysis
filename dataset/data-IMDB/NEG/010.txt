Was the blackout really as black as this?

The director spared no expense on the lighting of this film, in many parts nothing could be seen on the screen because the luminance was so low. Must have save a fortune on dressing the set with period objects, or was it to hide dodgy CGI, such as the little ships bound for Dunkirk ? The film concentrates on a very small period at the start of Churchill's premiership :- The speeches of 13/5/40 Blood Toil Sweat and 4/6/40 Fight them on the beaches. Gary Oldman is no Robert Hardy, even with maximum prosthetics. The film shows Churchill travelling on the underground and speaking to the people but this has not been documented in the history books and as it was only one stop to Westminster the scene was farcical in the length of time it took and how many people he managed to speak to in that time. Overall a film that promised much but delivered little.
