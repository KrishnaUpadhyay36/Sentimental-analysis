Biased and dull.

A woefully biased account of the 2016 Referendum where all the EU-supporters are honest, rational, and well-spoken and the opposite for the Brexit-supporters.

Cumberbatch's acting consists of twitching his face, waggling his arms and frowning. His accent travels from Chester to Newcastle, over to Wales, then towards London.

There is a story to be told one day with proper objectivity and good acting. Cumberbatch was too close to this as he has expressed his dismay at leaving the EU, perhaps he influenced the direction of the whole shoddy vehicle.

A one-trick pony for a no-trick film.
