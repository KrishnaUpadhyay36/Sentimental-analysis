I didn't realise Spider-Man was a comedy???

Was so looking forward to this, being a big Spider-Man fan. What a huge disappointment. I almost left before the end! 

Practically every line from every character is intended to get a laugh. I'm all for some humour, but get a balance for goodness sake! No drama in this film apart from one good, short scene between Holland and Keaton. The love interest is pathetic when compared to the previous Spider-Man films. His aunt is Moreisa Tomei? Seriously? She's supposed to be old! His friend/sidekick is just an annoying child constantly asking stupid annoying questions. Keaton is very underused and do we really need Iron Man in this? The typically frantic CGI action sequences are nothing but a blur most of the time, not much to enjoy there.

I suppose it's to be expected now, Marvel is all about the franchise and Phases. What a way to completely destroy one of the best comic book heroes!!!

Basically a big steaming pile of poo!!!
