More like a Disney movie for kids

I started to read Spiderman around 1979-80 somewhere there. I am not sure if he already then had finished high school and collage and moved on to university. I remember there were flashes tho of his past now and then. I also remember that his most boring period as i felt was in high school and after he got married, the period in between was the best.

this felt like an attempt of a semi funny Disney movie for kids where spider man or peter were squealing like a little girl during most of the time. i get that in this movie he is a little kid, but still he even in this age are supposed to be extremely strong, flexible almost impossible to hit cause of that and his of course famous spider sense that is totally forgotten.

I am not to keen on how they mix the original stories in with new, i felt it was pointless to drag in Ned Leeds into this ( its for us who read the magazines, to recognize the familiar caracthers ) as he was a journo at daily bugle much later and got involved in the hobgoblin mess which later got him killed.

Same with Iron Man and Tony Stark which although where mentioned now and then back in the days of the magazines, didn't figure much into the spider man stories. those heroes who popped up now and then was daredevil a blind leads a blind and other stories, punisher ( although as a villain )the Torch and Captain America.

i bet that when they bring the black cat into the picture they will focus on the most boring story as well, with the romance as always. 

I do understand to make it movie worthy things needs to be changed although i do think many spider man stories are good as they are.

This vulture didn't feel like the vulture but more of a cross between Iron man and the arch angel.

Sorry this movie wasn't for me, it was a disappointment
