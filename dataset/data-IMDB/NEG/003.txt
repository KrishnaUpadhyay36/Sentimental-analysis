Need new writers

I was totally unimpressed by the Spiderman. I watched it three times figuring I was wrong but I found each time I just wanted to smack the kid. He acted like he was 12 just hitting puberty. I don't blame the acting, as he did a great job, but I do blame the writers. Tom was following the script he was given and the directing. The saving grace to this movie was the cinematography, action and special effects. And of course Ironman.
