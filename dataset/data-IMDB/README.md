# Deployment Test Dataset

The reviews in this dataset is chosen from very current movies, mostly in 2017 and 2018. As a new test set, these data are really new, unseen and real.

1. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
   * POS 001/002/003/004/005
   * NEG 001
2. Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
   * POS 006/007
   * NEG 002/003/004/005
3. Brexit: The Uncivil War (2019 TV Movie)
   * POS 008/009
   * NEG 006/007
4. Darkest Hour (2017) 
   * POS 010
   * NEG 008/009/010

The underlying reasons for the deployment test are as follows:
* wrong assumptions about data (types of films, language)
* unrepresentative sampling
* model over- or underfitting
* taste and fashion over time
