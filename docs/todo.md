# THINGS TO DO 
**sentiment detection project**
---

1. ~~improve the structure of the project~~
2. ~~training and testing -- separated~~
3. implementation of the unsmoothing 
* when the smoothing parameter is missing, the classifier always misclassifies with the accuracy 1.0 and 0.0
4. check the correctness of the classifier
* either the full vocabulary is built on training set or entire dataset
5. significance testing -- again
6. POS tag -- w/ or w/o could make a difference in NB (Pang2002)
7. SVMLight as the implementation for the practical
8. gensim python doc2vec library
* training algorithm (dm, dbow)
* the size of the feature vectors (100 dimensions)
* number of iterations / epochs (10 or 20)
* context window
* hierarchical softmax (faster version)
