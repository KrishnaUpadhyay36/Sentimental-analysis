# THINGS TO DO 
**sentiment detection project**
---

1. ~~improve the structure of the project~~
2. ~~training and testing -- separated~~
3. implementation of the unsmoothing 
* when the smoothing parameter is missing, the classifier always misclassifies with the accuracy 1.0 and 0.0
4. check the correctness of the classifier
5. significance testing -- again
